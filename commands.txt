1. Create an SSH key: 
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "yunchen.lin8@gmail.com"

2. Finding out my SSH key: 
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub 

3. Add SSH key on GitHub

4. Set my local Git user name and email. 
git config --global user.name "Yun-Chen" 
git config --global user.email "yunchen.lin8@gmail.com"

5. Clone the repository on your PC. 
git clone https://github.com/Doris-Lin-Se/Yun-Chen-redi-school-git-assignment.git
## I used HTTPS instead of SSH. It works!  

6. cd Yun-Chen-redi-school-git-assignment

7. Create a file called commands.txt in the local copy of the repository.
touch commands.txt

8. Check the status of the local repository with the command 'git status'.
git status

9. Add the file to staged area.
git add commands.txt

10. Commit the file with a meaningful commit message.
git commit -m "Let's see it will work or not"

11. Push the local main branch to origin.
git push origin main
##unfortunately the updates were rejected because I changed readme.md file on GitHub.

12. Re-pull
git pull origin main

13. Push the local main branch to origin again and it asked me commid merge
git commid
git push origin main


Done!
